# Correlation-Analysis-of-Water-Potability-ü´ó
Simple correlation analysis fulfilling all the assumptions it requires. Data cleaning of outliers and normal distribution test.

When working with correlation analysis and either simple linear regression or logistic regression there are some assumptions that need to be fulfilled in order to continue with analysis. In this case I treat with 2 of them:

‚ùó Data must be normally distributed

‚ùó No outliers in data

You will see that the completion of the first assumption allows the completion of the second one. Finally, a conclusion is given where I differentiate causation and correlation. 

*The Python code and complete analysis is inside the notebook.*
